Side-channel timing leaks open a channel to an attacker to infer the value of a secret by observing the execution time of a function. For example, at the heart of the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is the modular exponentiation algorithm that computes (a^b\mod n), where ‘a' is an integer representing the plain text and ‘b’ is the integer encryption key. A careless implementation can leak ‘b’ through a probabilistic scheduling channel (see
attached figure). This program is not secure since the two branches of the if have different timing behaviors.

Under a fair execution scheduler for parallel threads, an attacker thread can infer the value of ‘b' by running in parallel to a modular exponentiation thread and iteratively incrementing a counter variable until the other thread terminates (lines 16-19). To model this program by an MDP, we can use two nondeterministic actions for the two branches of 
the if  statement, such that the choice of different schedulers corresponds to the choice of different bit configurations 'b(i)' for the key ‘b’.

This algorithm should satisfy the following property:
the probability of observing a concrete value in the counter ‘j' should 
be independent of the bit configuration of the secret key ‘b':
